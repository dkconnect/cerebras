# CEREBRAS 60 Second Hackathon

## Project Overview

This project is my submission for the **CEREBRAS 2025 Hackathon**. The application is a simple yet powerful **Note-taking app** that allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes with features like sorting, searching, dark mode toggle, and star marking for important notes. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and utilizes **localStorage** to persist data.

### Features

- **Note Creation**: Users can create a new note with a title and text content.
- **Sorting**: Sort notes by **Date (Ascending or Descending)**, **Importance**, and **Word Count**.
- **Search**: A search bar to find notes by keywords in the title or content.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for better readability.
- **Star Important Notes**: Mark notes as important using a star icon.
- **Delete Notes**: Delete unwanted notes from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
